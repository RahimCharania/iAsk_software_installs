## Create a singularity image that runs Firefox in your following directory:
mkdir ~/work/firefox
cd ~/work/firefox
singularity pull shub://jpetucci/firefox_icsaci

## Log into ACI-b with X11 forwarding on:
ssh USERID@aci-b.aci.ics.psu.edu -X -Y

## Submit an interactive batch job (you will need to change the resources based on your needs): 
$ qsub -I -X -A open -l nodes=1:ppn=2 -l walltime=4:00:00 

## After logging into the compute node, start a screen session:
$ screen

## Load the Python module:
$ module load python/3.6.3-anaconda5.0.1

## Activate your own environment, if any (optional):
$ source activate py36

## Spin up the Jupiter notebook:
$ jupyter notebook

## if it shows command not found, please do the following:
$ conda install jupyter notebook
$ jupyter notebook

## Copy the links for the notebook server and detach the screen session:
example address: http://localhost:8888/?token=de99f0c76cbcfcb183693ff0491f00f278d781bb3586ea8e

Type:
Ctrl+A+D

## Go to the folder that has the singularity image:
cd ~/work/firefox

## Open up the Firefox:
$ singularity exec jpetucci-firefox_icsaci-master-latest.simg /opt/firefox/./firefox

## Paste the address of the notebook server into the firefox and you should be able to use the jupyter notebook server on the compute node

## Now you can open the notebook and run your code!
